Simple program to solve an instance of the 15 puzzle.
Program will prompt user for (s/u), indicating if the test puzzle is or is not solvable.
Program will test if puzzle is solvable.
If not solvable, program will inform the user and terminate.
If solvable, program will then prompt user (b/d/i), for BFS, DFS or IDFS search respectively.
Program will then perform the search on the puzzle, and return the path to the solution.
Program expects user to input correct char inputs, and does not sanitize input.
